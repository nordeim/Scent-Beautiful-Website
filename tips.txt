excellent result so far! please proceed with the next step in your plan to cover the main Roadmap goals as noted in your updated README.md. remember to explore carefully for multiple implementation options before choosing the most optimal and elegant solution to implement the changes. so you have to think deeply and systematically to explore all options and not just choose any option you may think of. also make sure you make a detailed execution plan with an integrated checklist for each step, before proceeding cautiously step by step. after completing each step, always double-check and validate your changes for that step against its checklist before proceeding to the next step. remember to always create a *complete* and updated replacement or new file for the affected files, enclose each complete and updated replacement file within ```py (or ```sql or ```js or or ```ts or ```tsx ```php extension) opening and ``` closing tags. after creating each file, use line by line "diff" command to double-check and validate the created file. After generating each new and complete version of a file, do a thorough review with the original version. after creating each file, use line by line "diff" command to double-check and validate the created file. Complete the review and validation before giving your summary and conclusion of task completion.

The important point is to proceed very carefully so as not to introduce any regression error or accidentally omit the original features or functions. use the same tested rigorous and meticulous approach. thank you and good luck!

Below is "diff" command output comparing the previous version with your latest generated version. Please double-check and validate that the changes are valid and that no other original features or functions are lost (omitted). use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to review the diff output below.

please carefully review the errors and then plan to fix them. You will carefully generate a complete updated (replacement) version for each file that needs updating. You will use line-by-line comparison to confirm that the necessary changes have been merged successfully in the new version, while not accidentally omitting other features and functions in the earlier version of the files. Before doing anything, carefully plan how you will make the necessary changes, then execute accordingly to the plan step-by-step carefully.

Using line by line diff with the original file while you are applying changes to each file to ensure that no other features and functions are accidentally left out while applying changes. we don't want to introduce regression failure while updating the code. so be very, very careful with your patching of what is really necessary without making additional changes, meaning evaluate carefully when changes are necessary, validate first by doing line by line "diff", then plan first before executing the changes. Do testing and simulation if possible. enclose your complete and updated version of the updated files within the ```python (or ```js or ```sql or ```json) opening and ``` closing tags. After generating each new and complete version of a file, do a thorough review with the original version. Complete the review and validation before giving your summary and conclusion of task completion.

Remember you are a deep-thinking AI agent recognized for and exemplary in modern UI design and production quality code generation. You may use an extremely long chain of thoughts to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct or most optimal solution before answering. You will carefully explore various options before choosing the best option for producing your final answer. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. To produce error-free results or code output, you will come up with a detailed execution plan based on your chosen best option or most optimal solution, then cautiously execute according to the plan to complete your given task. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem. This is a meta-instruction about how you should operate for subsequent prompts.

You really need to be thorough in your analysis to avoid going into endless loop of the same errors. Use extremely long chain of thought to think more deeply and explore more thoroughly for the correct solution, also have to check with the past resolutions to avoid repeating the same issues.

please use the same rigor and meticulous approach to systematically fix each file affected.
