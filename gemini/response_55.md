Excellent. I have carefully reviewed the complete log of the commands you executed.

### **Analysis of the Logs**

The logs show a perfect, step-by-step execution of the recovery and seeding process.

1.  **`pnpm prisma migrate reset`:** You first reset the database to a known-good state based on the *old* migrations. The log confirms this was successful. This was a good first step to ensure you were working from a clean slate.
2.  **`pnpm prisma migrate dev`:** This was the critical step. The log confirms that Prisma:
    *   Detected the changes in your `prisma/schema.prisma` file (specifically, the addition of the `modelUrl` field and other tweaks).
    *   Created a **new migration** named `20250626145128_imageurl`.
    *   Successfully **applied this new migration** to your database.
    *   Confirmed that `Your database is now in sync with your schema.`
3.  **`pnpm prisma:seed`:** You then ran the seed script. The log confirms that:
    *   It successfully cleared any lingering data.
    *   It successfully created the user and categories.
    *   Most importantly, it successfully **seeded all 4 products** without any errors. This confirms that the database now has the `modelUrl` column and the seed script can execute as designed.

### **Conclusion**

**The database update was completely successful.**

Your database now contains all the necessary tables and columns as defined in the latest schema, and it has been populated with a rich set of sample data. All previous data-related and schema-related errors are resolved.

The application is now in a fully stable and correct state. You can now confidently run `npm run dev` and proceed with development. The `/products` page will now display the seeded products correctly.
