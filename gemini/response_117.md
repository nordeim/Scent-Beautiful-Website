The user wants me to review the latest logs and then propose a new execution plan to improve the checkout flow.

**Part 1: Log Review**

1.  **Analyze `pnpm dev` log:**
    *   `✓ Ready in 3.8s`: Healthy start.
    *   `✓ Compiled / in 13.4s (2686 modules)`: Successful compilation. Module count is stable and consistent with previous successful runs after my changes.
    *   The font fetching network errors are gone. This confirms they were likely transient environmental issues.
    *   `GET /products?_rsc=1bcmd 200 in 162ms`: This shows the user navigated to the shop page, which loaded successfully.
    *   `GET /api/trpc/product.getCategoryList... 200 in 1398ms`: The category filter bar on the shop page is working correctly.
    *   I see a successful login sequence.
    *   I see successful navigation to `/account/dashboard` and `/account/profile`.
    *   I see a successful `address.list` call.
    *   `POST /api/trpc/address.upsert?batch=1 200 in 95ms`: The user tested adding/editing an address. The log shows the `BEGIN`, `INSERT`, and `COMMIT` Prisma queries, confirming the transaction was successful. This validates the changes from Phase 2.
    *   `GET /cart... ✓ Compiled /cart in 1588ms`: Successful navigation to the cart page.
    *   `GET /checkout... ✓ Compiled /checkout in 4.1s`: Successful navigation to the checkout page.
    *   `POST /api/trpc/checkout.createPaymentIntent?batch=1 200 in 1192ms`: This is key. The log confirms that upon visiting `/checkout`, the `createPaymentIntent` mutation is immediately called. This is the behavior the user wants to change.
    *   The rest of the log shows successful API calls and no errors. The `^C` indicates a manual stop.

**Conclusion on Log Review:**
The logs are **perfectly healthy**. They show that all changes from the previous phases are working as intended. Crucially, the log confirms the user's observation: visiting `/checkout` immediately triggers Stripe initialization, which is the behavior we now need to refactor. The application is stable and ready for the next set of improvements.

**Part 2: Re-imagining the Checkout Flow**

The user's request is to evolve the checkout process from a single-page payment form into a more standard, multi-step flow.

*   **Current Flow:**
    1.  User clicks "Proceed to Checkout" from `/cart`.
    2.  Navigates to `/checkout`.
    3.  `/checkout` page immediately calls `createPaymentIntent`, fetches a Stripe client secret, and renders the combined Shipping Address + Payment form.

*   **Desired Flow:**
    1.  User clicks "Proceed to Checkout" from `/cart`.
    2.  Navigates to a new page (let's call it the "Information" step, e.g., `/checkout/information`).
    3.  This page allows the user to:
        *   Enter a shipping address.
        *   Or, if logged in, select from their saved addresses.
    4.  The user then clicks a "Continue to Payment" button.
    5.  This action might trigger navigation to a new "Payment" step (e.g., `/checkout/payment`).
    6.  *This* "Payment" page is where the `createPaymentIntent` mutation is called and the Stripe Payment Element is rendered.
    7.  The final payable amount, including GST and any potential shipping costs, is displayed here.
    8.  User clicks "Pay Now" to finalize the transaction.

This is a much more robust and user-friendly flow. It aligns with best practices for e-commerce.

**Thinking about Implementation Options:**

1.  **Multi-Page Checkout:**
    *   `/checkout/information`: A page for address entry/selection.
    *   `/checkout/shipping`: (Optional) A page for selecting shipping methods.
    *   `/checkout/payment`: A final page for payment.
    *   *Pros:* Very clear separation of steps. Each URL represents a distinct stage. State can be passed between pages via query params or a persistent store.
    *   *Cons:* Can feel a bit slow with full page reloads between each step. Managing state across multiple pages can be complex if not handled carefully.

2.  **Single-Page, Multi-Step Checkout (Accordion/Tabs):**
    *   A single `/checkout` page that presents the steps (Information, Shipping, Payment) as collapsible accordion sections or tabs.
    *   The user completes one section, and the next one becomes active.
    *   *Pros:* Feels faster, no full page reloads. All state is managed within one component.
    *   *Cons:* Can become a very large and complex single component. State management can be tricky. URL doesn't reflect the current step.

3.  **Hybrid Approach (Single Page, Client-Side Router):**
    *   Use a single Next.js route (`/checkout/[[...step]].tsx`). The `[[...step]]` makes it a catch-all optional route.
    *   Manage the "step" (information, payment) with client-side state.
    *   When the user progresses, use `router.push('/checkout/payment', { scroll: false })` to update the URL without a full page reload, while rendering the next step's component.
    *   *Pros:* Best of both worlds. The URL reflects the user's progress, state can be managed in a parent component, and transitions are fast (client-side). This is a very modern and common pattern.

**Chosen Option:** The Hybrid Approach (Option 3). This is the most elegant and performant solution. It gives the user a fast, single-page-app-like experience while maintaining clean, shareable URLs for each step.

**Re-imagined Flow using Hybrid Approach:**

1.  **Cart (`/cart`):** The "Proceed to Checkout" button will now link to `/checkout/information`.
2.  **Information Step (`/checkout/information`):**
    *   Rendered by a new page file: `app/(shop)/checkout/[[...step]]/page.tsx`.
    *   This page component will check the `step` param. If it's `information` or empty, it renders the `InformationStep` component.
    *   The `InformationStep` component will contain the shipping address form and the list of saved addresses for logged-in users.
    *   Crucially, it will **not** call `createPaymentIntent`.
    *   The "Continue to Payment" button will validate the address and then programmatically navigate the user to `/checkout/payment`. The address data will be saved to a shared state.
3.  **Payment Step (`/checkout/payment`):**
    *   The same page file (`app/(shop)/checkout/[[...step]]/page.tsx`) will see the `step` is `payment` and will render the `PaymentStep` component.
    *   The parent page will now take the address from the shared state and **only now** call the `createPaymentIntent` mutation.
    *   The `PaymentStep` component will receive the `clientSecret` and render the Stripe Payment Element.
    *   The Order Summary will be displayed here, showing the final total including all taxes.
4.  **State Management:** We need a way to share the entered/selected shipping address between the `InformationStep` and the `PaymentStep`.
    *   **Option A: Zustand Store.** Create a new `checkout.store.ts`. This is clean, robust, and decouples the state from the component tree.
    *   **Option B: React Context.** Wrap the checkout steps in a Context Provider. Simpler for this specific use case, but less scalable if more complex state is needed later.
    *   **Decision:** A dedicated Zustand store (`checkout.store.ts`) is the superior choice. It aligns with the project's existing state management patterns (`cart.store`, `ui.store`) and is more flexible for future additions (like storing a selected shipping method).

**Detailed Execution Plan**

This is a significant refactor. I'll break it down into careful, logical steps.

**Phase 3 (Revised): The Multi-Step Checkout Refactor**

*   **Goal:** Transform the checkout from a single page into a modern, multi-step process for address selection and payment, while correctly calculating and displaying GST.

*   **Step 3.1: Create the Checkout State Store**
    *   **File to Create:** `store/checkout.store.ts`
    *   **Changes:**
        *   Define a Zustand store.
        *   State should include `shippingAddress: TAddressSchema | null`.
        *   Actions should include `setShippingAddress: (address: TAddressSchema) => void`.
        *   Use `persist` middleware to save the address to `sessionStorage` (not `localStorage`), so it's cleared when the browser tab is closed, which is appropriate for checkout data.
    *   **Validation Checklist:**
        *   [ ] The file is created correctly.
        *   [ ] The store has the correct state shape and actions.

*   **Step 3.2: Create the New Catch-All Checkout Route**
    *   **File to Rename:** Rename `app/(shop)/checkout/page.tsx` to `app/(shop)/checkout/[[...step]]/page.tsx`. This makes it a catch-all route that can handle `/checkout`, `/checkout/information`, and `/checkout/payment`.
    *   **File to Create:** `components/features/checkout/InformationStep.tsx` (by moving the address form out of the old `CheckoutForm`).
    *   **File to Create:** `components/features/checkout/PaymentStep.tsx` (by moving the payment element part out of the old `CheckoutForm`).
    *   **File to Refactor:** `app/(shop)/checkout/[[...step]]/page.tsx`
        *   **Changes:** This becomes the "controller" page.
        *   It will read the `step` from the `params`.
        *   It will use client-side state to determine which step component to render (`InformationStep` or `PaymentStep`).
        *   It will manage the checkout state using the new Zustand store.
    *   **Validation Checklist:**
        *   [ ] Navigating to `/cart` and clicking "Proceed to Checkout" (after I update the link) should land on a URL like `/checkout/information`.
        *   [ ] The Information step UI should render correctly.

*   **Step 3.3: Implement the Information Step**
    *   **File to Refactor:** `components/features/checkout/InformationStep.tsx`
    *   **Changes:**
        *   This component will contain the address form.
        *   It will fetch saved addresses for logged-in users (`api.address.list.useQuery`).
        *   It will allow users to select a saved address or fill out the form for a new one.
        *   The "Continue to Payment" button will:
            1.  Validate the form data.
            2.  Save the selected/entered address to the `checkout.store`.
            3.  Use `router.push('/checkout/payment')` to navigate to the next step.
    *   **Validation Checklist:**
        *   [ ] Users can select a saved address, and it populates the form.
        *   [ ] Users can fill out the form manually.
        *   [ ] Clicking "Continue to Payment" with valid data saves the address to the store and navigates to the payment step URL.

*   **Step 3.4: Implement the Payment Step**
    *   **File to Refactor:** `app/(shop)/checkout/[[...step]]/page.tsx`
        *   **Changes:** The `createPaymentIntent` mutation call will be moved here, inside a `useEffect` that triggers **only when the step is 'payment'** and a shipping address exists in the store.
    *   **File to Refactor:** `components/features/checkout/PaymentStep.tsx`
    *   **Changes:**
        *   This component will now be much simpler. It will primarily receive the `clientSecret` as a prop.
        *   It will render the `<Elements>` provider and the `PaymentElement`.
        *   The "Pay Now" button logic will be here, calling `stripe.confirmPayment`.
    *   **File to Refactor:** The "Order Summary" component (which will be part of the main page `app/(shop)/checkout/[[...step]]/page.tsx`).
    *   **Changes:** It will now display the final, authoritative price breakdown (subtotal, GST, total) received from the `createPaymentIntent` mutation.
    *   **Validation Checklist:**
        *   [ ] The Stripe payment element only renders on the `/checkout/payment` step.
        *   [ ] The `createPaymentIntent` API call is only made when the user reaches the payment step.
        *   [ ] The Order Summary correctly displays the subtotal, GST, and final total.

*   **Step 3.5: Update Cart Page Link**
    *   **File to Modify:** `app/(shop)/cart/page.tsx`
    *   **Changes:** Update the `Link` component for the "Proceed to Checkout" button to point to `/checkout/information`.
    *   **Validation Checklist:**
        *   [ ] The button on the cart page now correctly links to the start of the new checkout flow.

This revised plan is much more robust and aligns with modern e-commerce best practices. It's a significant refactor, but it's the right architectural decision. I'm ready to present this plan.Of course. I have completed a thorough review of the provided logs and your request.

### **Log Review & Analysis**

The logs you've provided are **healthy and show no signs of application error**.

1.  **Dependency Installation (`pnpm add`)**: Your handling of the `pnpm` build script prompt for `esbuild` was **correct and appropriate**. Approving trusted build tools is a standard and necessary step for `pnpm`'s security model. The installation was successful.
2.  **Application Startup (`pnpm dev`)**: The application compiles and runs successfully. The logs confirm that the changes from the previous phases are working as intended, including the successful `address.upsert` database transaction.
3.  **Checkout Flow Confirmation**: The log entry `POST /api/trpc/checkout.createPaymentIntent?batch=1 200...` confirms your key observation: navigating to `/checkout` currently triggers the payment initialization immediately. This is the behavior we will now refactor.

**Conclusion**: The application is stable and ready for the next phase. The logs validate the need for the requested checkout flow improvement.

### **Re-imagining the Checkout Flow: A Deep Dive**

Your request to decouple address entry from payment initialization is an excellent architectural improvement. It aligns with modern e-commerce best practices, improves user experience, and makes the flow more robust.

I have systematically explored several implementation strategies:

1.  **Multi-Page Approach**: Using distinct Next.js routes like `/checkout/address` and `/checkout/payment`. This is simple to reason about but results in full page reloads, which can feel slow and disjointed.
2.  **Single-Page Accordion**: Using a single `/checkout` page with collapsible sections. This is fast but creates a very large, complex component and the URL doesn't reflect the user's progress.
3.  **Hybrid "Catch-All" Route Approach**: This is the most optimal and elegant solution. It uses a single dynamic route file (`app/(shop)/checkout/[[...step]]/page.tsx`) to handle multiple steps (`/checkout/information`, `/checkout/payment`). This provides the speed of a single-page app (client-side transitions) while maintaining clean, stateful URLs. State between steps can be managed by a lightweight, dedicated state store.

**Chosen Strategy**: I will implement the **Hybrid "Catch-All" Route Approach (Option 3)** using a dedicated **Zustand store** for state management. This is the superior pattern for performance, user experience, and maintainability.

### **Detailed Execution Plan: The Multi-Step Checkout Refactor**

This plan refactors the checkout process into a logical, two-step flow managed by a single, intelligent route.

#### **Phase 3 (Revised) - Step 3.1: Create the Checkout State Store**

*   **Goal**: To create a client-side store that will hold the shipping address information as the user moves from the information step to the payment step.
*   **File to Create**: `store/checkout.store.ts`
*   **Changes**:
    *   Define a new Zustand store to hold the `shippingAddress`.
    *   Use `sessionStorage` for persistence. This is better than `localStorage` for temporary checkout data as it's automatically cleared when the user closes the browser tab, enhancing privacy.
*   **Validation Checklist**:
    *   [ ] The file `store/checkout.store.ts` is created.
    *   [ ] The store correctly defines state for `shippingAddress` and an action `setShippingAddress`.

#### **Phase 3 (Revised) - Step 3.2: Implement the New Catch-All Checkout Route & Step Components**

*   **Goal**: To create the new routing structure and the components for each step.
*   **Action**:
    1.  Rename `app/(shop)/checkout/page.tsx` to `app/(shop)/checkout/[[...step]]/page.tsx`.
    2.  Create two new empty component files: `components/features/checkout/InformationStep.tsx` and `components/features/checkout/PaymentStep.tsx`. We will populate these in the next steps.
*   **Validation Checklist**:
    *   [ ] The file `app/(shop)/checkout/page.tsx` no longer exists.
    *   [ ] The new file `app/(shop)/checkout/[[...step]]/page.tsx` exists.
    *   [ ] The two new placeholder component files exist.

#### **Phase 3 (Revised) - Step 3.3: Build the Information Step**

*   **Goal**: To create the UI for entering or selecting a shipping address. This step will *not* interact with Stripe.
*   **Files to Modify**:
    *   `app/(shop)/cart/page.tsx`: Update the "Proceed to Checkout" button's link.
    *   `components/features/checkout/InformationStep.tsx`: Build the address form and selection logic.
*   **Validation Checklist**:
    *   [ ] The button on the `/cart` page now links to `/checkout/information`.
    *   [ ] The `/checkout/information` page correctly displays the address form.
    *   [ ] For logged-in users, it displays a list of their saved addresses.
    *   [ ] Clicking "Continue to Payment" with a valid address navigates the user to `/checkout/payment` and saves the address in the Zustand store.

#### **Phase 3 (Revised) - Step 3.4: Build the Payment Step & Controller Logic**

*   **Goal**: To create the final payment page, which will now be responsible for initializing Stripe and handling the payment.
*   **Files to Modify**:
    *   `app/(shop)/checkout/[[...step]]/page.tsx`: This "controller" component will manage rendering the correct step and will now be responsible for triggering the `createPaymentIntent` mutation.
    *   `components/features/checkout/PaymentStep.tsx`: This component will be simplified to just render the Stripe payment form.
*   **Validation Checklist**:
    *   [ ] The `createPaymentIntent` API call is **only** made when the user is on the `/checkout/payment` step.
    *   [ ] The Stripe Payment Element is **only** rendered on the payment step.
    *   [ ] The Order Summary on the payment step correctly displays the final amount, including the 9% GST calculated on the server.

I have completed the detailed planning. This is a robust architectural refactor that will significantly improve the application. Upon your approval, I will proceed with the execution, starting with **Step 3.1**.
