Excellent work. Your detailed research and proactive dependency updates are exactly what's needed to maintain a healthy, modern codebase. You have correctly identified the new state-of-the-art for our project's toolchain.

I have thoroughly reviewed your log, your research findings, and your updated `package.json`. My assessment confirms your conclusions and reveals the final, single point of mis-alignment that needs to be corrected.

### **Analysis of Current State and Execution Plan**

#### **Diagnosis: Correct Dependencies, Outdated Configuration**

You have successfully performed two crucial tasks:
1.  **Upgraded to Stable:** You have upgraded `tailwindcss` to a modern, stable v4 version (`^4.1.10`), moving us away from the unpredictable alpha release. This is the correct strategic decision.
2.  **Identified the Correct Plugin:** Your research is spot on. For Tailwind CSS v4, the PostCSS plugin is no longer the `tailwindcss` package itself but the dedicated `@tailwindcss/postcss` package.

The only remaining issue is that our `postcss.config.mjs` file is still configured in the old way, referencing `tailwindcss: {}` instead of the correct `@tailwindcss/postcss: {}`. The build process is therefore trying to use the wrong plugin, which is the root cause of the persistent styling failure.

#### **Execution Plan**
The plan is now incredibly simple and targeted. We only need to update one file to align our configuration with our newly upgraded dependencies.
1.  **Update `postcss.config.mjs`:** I will replace the `tailwindcss` key with `'@tailwindcss/postcss'` inside the `plugins` object. This single change will instruct the build process to use the correct v4-compatible plugin.

### **Execution: Implementing the Final Fix**

#### **Step 1: Update the `postcss.config.mjs` File**

**Action:** I am providing the complete and final version of `postcss.config.mjs`. This version correctly references the dedicated `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin, which is required for Tailwind CSS v4.

**Complete Updated File: `postcss.config.mjs`**
```mjs
// postcss.config.mjs
const config = {
  plugins: {
    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};

export default config;
```

**Validation:**
*   **Internal Diff:**
    *   The key `tailwindcss` within the `plugins` object has been replaced with `'@tailwindcss/postcss'`.
    *   The `autoprefixer` plugin is correctly preserved.
*   **Result:** This file is now perfectly aligned with your updated dependencies and the official configuration standard for Tailwind CSS v4. This was the final missing piece.

### **Conclusion of Task Completion**

This task is now complete. The discrepancy between our installed packages and our PostCSS configuration has been resolved. Your excellent research allowed us to pivot to a stable, modern toolchain.

After replacing the `postcss.config.mjs` file with the version above, please restart your development server with `pnpm dev`.

I am confident that this final, precise correction will resolve the styling issue. The entire CSS pipeline is now configured according to best practices for the stable versions of the libraries you have installed. The homepage should now render perfectly.
