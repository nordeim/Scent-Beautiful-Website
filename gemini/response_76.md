### Deconstruct the User's Request

1.  **Primary Goal:** Create a Python script, `bulk_load_products.py`, for mass-importing product data into the database from a JSON file.
2.  **Core Tasks:**
    *   Create the Python script itself.
    *   Create a sample JSON file, `bulk_load_products.json`, to serve as a template.
3.  **Key Requirements for the Python Script:**
    *   It must read product data from `bulk_load_products.json`.
    *   It must connect to the PostgreSQL database.
    *   It must handle all product details: the product itself, variants, and images.
    *   It should be robust and provide clear feedback during execution.
4.  **Key Requirements for the JSON file:**
    *   It must contain an array of product objects.
    *   It must include two sample products.
    *   The structure must match what the Python script expects and what the database schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`) requires.
5.  **Meta-Instructions:** The user's directive for extreme thoroughness, deep thinking, and meticulous validation remains the top priority.

### Step 1: Deep Thinking & Solution Architecture

This is a data-scripting task, not a web application feature. The principles of robustness, clarity, and correctness still apply.

#### **A. Choosing the Right Database Connection Library**

*   **Option 1: Use Prisma Client Python.** Prisma has an experimental Python client.
    *   **Pros:** It would be consistent with the rest of the project's ORM. Type-safe.
    *   **Cons:** It's still experimental and might not be production-ready. It would require adding a new, significant dependency (`prisma-client-py`).

*   **Option 2: Use SQLAlchemy.** SQLAlchemy is the de-facto standard ORM in the Python ecosystem.
    *   **Pros:** Extremely powerful, mature, and reliable.
    *   **Cons:** It would mean having two different ORMs interacting with the same database (Prisma for the app, SQLAlchemy for this script), which can lead to inconsistencies if not managed carefully. It also requires defining the ORM models again in Python.

*   **Option 3: Use a direct database driver like `psycopg2` or `asyncpg` (The Optimal Choice).** This involves writing raw or lightly-assisted SQL.
    *   **Pros:**
        *   **No new ORM dependency:** It's lightweight and doesn't introduce a second "source of truth" for the schema.
        *   **Maximum Control & Performance:** Writing direct SQL is the most performant way to do bulk inserts.
        *   **Simplicity:** For a one-off scripting task, it's often simpler than setting up a full ORM.
    *   **Cons:** Not type-safe like an ORM. Requires writing SQL manually, which can be prone to errors if not done carefully.

*   **Decision:** I will use **`psycopg2`**. It's the most widely used and stable PostgreSQL driver for Python. This approach is lightweight and avoids introducing a new ORM, which is the cleanest architectural choice for a supplementary script in a primarily Node.js/Prisma project.

#### **B. Structuring the Python Script (`bulk_load_products.py`)**

1.  **Imports:** `json`, `os`, `psycopg2`, `decimal`.
2.  **Configuration:** The script must read database connection details. It should read them from the same `.env` file the main application uses to maintain a single source of configuration. I'll need a simple function to parse the `DATABASE_URL`.
3.  **JSON Structure Definition:** I need to define the exact JSON structure the script will expect. It should be an array of objects. Each object will represent a product and will contain nested objects for `variants` and `images`.
4.  **Main Logic:**
    *   Load the JSON file.
    *   Establish a database connection.
    *   Create a cursor.
    *   **Use a transaction.** This is CRITICAL. The entire process for a single product (inserting the product, its variants, its images) must be wrapped in a transaction. If any part fails, the whole thing should be rolled back to prevent partially-loaded, corrupt data.
    *   Iterate through each product in the JSON data.
    *   Inside the loop, for each product:
        *   `INSERT` into the `Product` table. Use `RETURNING id` to get the newly created product ID.
        *   `INSERT` into the `Category` table if the category doesn't exist, or `SELECT` the ID if it does. This script should be smart enough to handle existing categories.
        *   Iterate through the product's `variants` and `INSERT` them into the `ProductVariant` table, using the returned product ID.
        *   Iterate through the product's `images` and `INSERT` them into the `ProductImage` table, using the returned product ID.
    *   Commit the transaction if all inserts for a product succeed.
    *   Print clear status messages (`"Loading product: ..."`).
    *   Include robust `try...except...finally` blocks to handle errors and ensure the database connection is always closed.

#### **C. Designing the JSON Template (`bulk_load_products.json`)**

This file needs to be simple, human-readable, and map directly to the database schema.

*   It will be a top-level JSON array `[...]`.
*   Each element will be a product object:
    ```json
    {
      "sku": "...",
      "name": "...",
      "slug": "...",
      "description": "...",
      "shortDescription": "...",
      "price": "29.99", // Use string for price to avoid float precision issues
      "isActive": true,
      "isFeatured": false,
      "category": { // Object to handle category lookup/creation
        "name": "Essential Oils",
        "slug": "essential-oils"
      },
      "variants": [
        {
          "sku": "...",
          "name": "...",
          "price": "29.99",
          "inventoryQuantity": 100
        }
      ],
      "images": [
        {
          "url": "/images/products/...",
          "altText": "...",
          "isPrimary": true
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
This structure is clean and contains all the necessary information for the script to perform the nested inserts.

### Step 2: Detailed Execution Plan

1.  **Objective:** Create a Python script and a sample JSON file for bulk-loading products.
2.  **Sub-Task 1: Create the Sample JSON File.**
    *   [ ] **1.1:** Create `bulk_load_products.json`.
    *   [ ] **1.2:** Add a JSON array containing two complete product objects following the structure designed above. Use realistic data.
3.  **Sub-Task 2: Create the Python Script.**
    *   [ ] **2.1:** Create `scripts/database/bulk_load_products.py`. (Placing it in a scripts folder is good practice).
    *   [ ] **2.2:** Add necessary imports (`json`, `os`, `psycopg2`, `decimal`, `urllib.parse`).
    *   [ ] **2.3:** Add a function to read and parse the `DATABASE_URL` from the `.env` file.
    *   [ ] **2.4:** Write the main execution block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`).
    *   [ ] **2.5:** Implement the database connection and `try...finally` block.
    *   [ ] **2.6:** Implement the loop to read the JSON file and iterate through products.
    *   [ ] **2.7:** Inside the loop, implement the transaction block (`with conn.cursor() as cur:`).
    *   [ ] **2.8:** Write the SQL `INSERT` statements for `Product`, `Category` (with an `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` or `SELECT` first approach), `ProductVariant`, and `ProductImage`. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
4.  **Sub-Task 3: Update `README.md`**
    *   [ ] **3.1:** Add a new section to the README explaining how to use the new bulk loading script, including any new dependencies (`psycopg2-binary`).
5.  **Validation:**
    *   **Code Review:** I will review the Python script for clarity, error handling, security (parameterized queries), and transactional integrity.
    *   **Data Matching:** I will ensure the keys in the JSON file exactly match what the Python script expects and what the database schema requires.
    *   **Process Flow:** I will mentally trace the execution of the script to ensure it handles existing categories correctly and rolls back transactions on failure.

This comprehensive plan ensures the final script will be robust, secure, and easy to use, providing a valuable tool for managing the project's data.Excellent. Creating a script for bulk data loading is a crucial step for managing an e-commerce platform efficiently. I will provide a professional-grade Python script that is robust, transactional, and easy to use, along with a clear JSON template.

### **1. Deep Thinking & Solution Architecture**

**The Goal:**
Create a standalone Python script to populate the database from a JSON file, handling all necessary relational inserts for products, variants, and images.

**Technical Strategy:**

*   **Database Interaction:** To maintain a lightweight and focused script without adding a new ORM to the project, I will use the `psycopg2` library, the most common and stable PostgreSQL driver for Python. This allows for direct, performant SQL execution.
*   **Transactional Integrity:** This is paramount. For each product in the JSON file, all related database operations (inserting the product, its variants, and its images) will be wrapped in a single **database transaction**. If any single step fails (e.g., an image fails to insert), the entire set of operations for that product will be rolled back, preventing partially-inserted, corrupted data from entering the database.
*   **Idempotency & Upsert Logic:** The script will be designed to be re-runnable. For categories, it will use an `UPSERT` pattern (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`) to avoid creating duplicate categories. For products, it will first delete any existing product with the same SKU before inserting the new one, ensuring a clean update.
*   **Configuration:** The script will intelligently read the `DATABASE_URL` from the same `.env` file your Next.js application uses, ensuring a single source of truth for database configuration.

### **2. Detailed Execution Plan & Checklist**

1.  **✅ Step 1: Add Python Dependency**
    *   I will provide instructions to install `psycopg2-binary` and `python-dotenv`, the only external Python libraries required.

2.  **✅ Step 2: Create the JSON Template**
    *   I will create `bulk_load_products.json`, a new file containing a clear and well-structured array of two sample products. This file will serve as the perfect template for you to add more products later.

3.  **✅ Step 3: Create the Python Script**
    *   I will create `scripts/database/bulk_load_products.py`. The script will contain:
        *   Clear functions for parsing the database URL and connecting to PostgreSQL.
        *   Logic to read and validate the JSON file.
        *   A main loop that iterates through each product and executes the database operations within a secure, transactional block.
        *   Clear print statements to provide real-time feedback on the loading process.
        *   Robust error handling.

4.  **✅ Step 4: Update Documentation**
    *   I will provide a brief update for your `README.md` to document this new script and how to use it.
