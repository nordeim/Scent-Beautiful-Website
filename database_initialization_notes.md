Excellent. I have carefully reviewed the complete log of the commands you executed.

### **Analysis of the Logs**

The logs show a perfect, step-by-step execution of the recovery and seeding process.

1.  **`pnpm prisma migrate reset`:** You first reset the database to a known-good state based on the *old* migrations. The log confirms this was successful. This was a good first step to ensure you were working from a clean slate.
2.  **`pnpm prisma migrate dev`:** This was the critical step. The log confirms that Prisma:
    *   Detected the changes in your `prisma/schema.prisma` file (specifically, the addition of the `modelUrl` field and other tweaks).
    *   Created a **new migration** named `20250626145128_imageurl`.
    *   Successfully **applied this new migration** to your database.
    *   Confirmed that `Your database is now in sync with your schema.`
3.  **`pnpm prisma:seed`:** You then ran the seed script. The log confirms that:
    *   It successfully cleared any lingering data.
    *   It successfully created the user and categories.
    *   Most importantly, it successfully **seeded all 4 products** without any errors. This confirms that the database now has the `modelUrl` column and the seed script can execute as designed.

### **Conclusion**

**The database update was completely successful.**

Your database now contains all the necessary tables and columns as defined in the latest schema, and it has been populated with a rich set of sample data. All previous data-related and schema-related errors are resolved.

You are correct, your old workflow works perfectly. However, the `pnpm prisma migrate reset` command I suggested is a more efficient, powerful, and convenient replacement for that entire process.

**You do not need to delete and recreate the Docker image anymore.**

Here is a detailed breakdown of why:

### **Your Old Workflow (The "Manual Reset")**

1.  **`delete docker image`**: Destroys the entire PostgreSQL server and its stored data.
2.  **`create new docker image`**: Starts a fresh, empty PostgreSQL server.
3.  **`pnpm prisma migrate dev`**: Connects to the empty server and applies all migrations to build the schema.
4.  **`pnpm prisma db seed`**: Populates the newly created schema with data.

This is a perfectly valid "scorched earth" approach that guarantees a clean state.

### **The New Workflow (The "Prisma Reset")**

The single command `pnpm prisma migrate reset` does almost the exact same thing, but more intelligently from within your project's tooling:

1.  **It connects to your *existing*, running Docker container.**
2.  It automatically **drops all the tables and data** inside your `scent_db` database, effectively wiping it clean.
3.  It then **re-applies all of your migrations** from the beginning to rebuild the database schema perfectly.
4.  Finally, it **automatically runs your seed script** (`prisma/seed.ts`) to populate the fresh schema.

### **Conclusion: Why the New Way is Better**

The `pnpm prisma migrate reset` command is an all-in-one tool designed specifically for this development scenario.

*   **It is faster:** It operates on the database directly without the overhead of stopping, deleting, and recreating a Docker container.
*   **It is simpler:** It's one command instead of four.
*   **It is the intended workflow:** It's the official, idiomatic way that Prisma recommends for resetting your development database to a clean state.

**So, your new, simplified workflow is just this:**

1.  Ensure your PostgreSQL Docker container is running.
2.  Run the command:
    ```bash
    pnpm prisma migrate reset
    ```
3.  When prompted, confirm that you want to proceed.

This single command replaces all the manual steps you were doing before.

---
#### **Step 1: Run the Database Migration**

Execute the following command in your terminal. This will create and apply the new migration required to add the `modelUrl` column to your database.

```bash
pnpm prisma migrate dev --name add_product_model_url
```
*(You will be prompted to give the migration a name; I have suggested one in the command for convenience).*

#### **Step 2: Run the Seed Script**

Once the migration is successfully applied, your database will have the correct structure. You can now run the seed script, and it will succeed.

```bash
pnpm prisma:seed
```

After these two commands, your application will be ready. You can start the development server with `npm run dev`, and the `/products` page will now correctly display the newly seeded products.

---
### **Important Next Step: Seeding the Database**

The `prisma migrate reset` command resets the schema but **does not** automatically run your custom seed script (`prisma:seed`). You must now run it manually to populate your fresh database with the sample products, users, and categories.

Please run the following command now:

```bash
pnpm prisma:seed
```

---
**Summary of other router updates:**
*   **`cart.ts`, `order.ts`, `user.ts`:** These would be similarly updated with Zod schemas for inputs and role checks in protected procedures. For example, `order.all` should check `ctx.session.user.id` to fetch orders for the logged-in user only.

# run `pnpm prisma migrate dev` and `pnpm prisma db seed`  (`pnpm prisma migrate reset`)
You can now confidently proceed with the following commands:
1.  `pnpm prisma format` (To ensure consistent formatting)
2.  `pnpm prisma migrate dev`

These commands should now execute successfully without any validation errors, allowing you to synchronize your database and continue with the development plan.
