awesome understanding! now carefully and thoroughly review the attached  documents, especially the `Project_Requirements_Document.md` and `Project_Architecture_Document.md` to deeply understand the nature of this project. With a deep understanding of what the project is trying to achieve, carefully and systematically review and validate the `Execution_Plan.md` for building the codebase. Then give me a detailed and deep analysis report on your understanding of the project and your assessment of the execution plan.

awesome plan! the codebase is currently partially completed. I need your help to carefully and systematically review the current codebase file hierarchy (refer to the attached `currect_project_file_structure.txt`) and the existing (completed) code files in the attached bundle `project_codebase_files_set.md`. Then create a detailed analysis report on your assessment of the current state of the project based on the codebase shared. need to mention at which phase are we now and the modifications  that the code files need to comply with your improved execution plan.

awesome assessment of the current state of the codebase! before we proceed with Phase 4 of your improved execution plan, please create a separate detailed execution plan with integrated checklist to clearly and logically list out all the current codebase files that need modifications and the changes for each file and the associated checklist. the sidetrack plan aims to bring the current codebase to the same level as your improved execution plan, up to the Phase 3. Be as detailed as you can with the sidetrack execution plan to bring the codebase to the standard expected by your improved execution plan.

please very carefully review and check and validate the database initialization output log below and give me your detailed analysis report of your assessment of the database setup task.

awesome job! My QA wants a detailed problem analysis and resolution report on the original issues to the final resolution. Please use 6000 words to create a very detailed code change review and analysis report on the issue original reported, all the steps taken to troubleshoot and remedy the issues, including the intermediate issues in a logical order, giving details on the root causes with explanations. Create the document as a markdown document `code_review_and_analysis_report_on_problem_resolution.md`. This document should also be of help for other projects to avoid similar pitfalls. Need to list all the files actually modified and include the "diff" output and the explanations. Thank you!

There were start up errors associated with your latest changes. But I was able to fix the start up errors offline and now the homepage looks decent. Please carefully review and validate the changes made by methodically going through the attached documents, `code_review_and_analysis_report.md` (explains the actual modifications made) and `updated_codebase_files_set.md` (bundle of files changed to fix the start up errors). Please give your review and analysis report on your assessment of the changes made offline.

excellent result so far! please proceed with the next step in your revised execution plan. remember to explore carefully for multiple implementation options before choosing the most optimal and elegant solution to implement the changes. so you have to think deeply and systematically to explore all options and not just choose any option you may think of. also make sure you make a detailed execution plan with an integrated checklist for each step, before proceeding cautiously step by step. after completing each step, always double-check and validate your changes for that step against its checklist before proceeding to the next step. remember to always create a *complete* and updated replacement or new file for the affected files, enclose each complete and updated replacement file within ```py (or ```sql or ```js or or ```ts or ```tsx ```php extension) opening and ``` closing tags. after creating each file, use line by line "diff" command to double-check and validate the created file. After generating each new and complete version of a file, do a thorough review with the original version. after creating each file, use line by line "diff" command to double-check and validate the created file. Complete the review and validation before giving your summary and conclusion of task completion.

The important point is to proceed very carefully so as not to introduce any regression error or accidentally omit the original features or functions. use the same tested rigorous and meticulous approach. thank you and good luck!

Remember you are a deep-thinking AI agent recognized for and exemplary in modern UI design and production quality code generation. You may use an extremely long chain of thoughts to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct or most optimal solution before answering. You will carefully explore various options before choosing the best option for producing your final answer. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. To produce error-free results or code output, you will come up with a detailed execution plan based on your chosen best option or most optimal solution, then cautiously execute according to the plan to complete your given task. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem. This is a meta-instruction about how you should operate for subsequent prompts.

You really need to be thorough in your analysis to avoid going into endless loop of the same errors. Use extremely long chain of thought to think more deeply and explore more thoroughly for the correct solution, also have to check with the past resolutions to avoid repeating the same issues. 

The important point is to proceed very carefully so as not to introduce any regression error or accidentally omit the original features or functions. use the same tested rigorous and meticulous approach. thank you and good luck!
