awesome understanding! now carefully and thoroughly review the attached  documents, especially the `Project_Requirements_Document.md` and `Project_Architecture_Document.md` to deeply understand the nature of this project. With a deep understanding of what the project is trying to achieve, carefully and systematically review and validate the `Execution_Plan.md` for building the codebase. Then give me a detailed and deep analysis report on your understanding of the project and your assessment of the execution plan.

awesome plan! the codebase is currently partially completed. I need your help to carefully and systematically review the current codebase file hierarchy (refer to the attached `currect_project_file_structure.txt`) and the existing (completed) code files in the attached bundle `project_codebase_files_set.md`. Then create a detailed analysis report on your assessment of the current state of the project based on the codebase shared. need to mention at which phase are we now and the modifications  that the code files need to comply with your improved execution plan.

awesome assessment of the current state of the codebase! before we proceed with Phase 4 of your improved execution plan, please create a separate detailed execution plan with integrated checklist to clearly and logically list out all the current codebase files that need modifications and the changes for each file and the associated checklist. the sidetrack plan aims to bring the current codebase to the same level as your improved execution plan, up to the Phase 3. Be as detailed as you can with the sidetrack execution plan to bring the codebase to the standard expected by your improved execution plan.

awesome job! My QA wants a detailed problem analysis and resolution report on the original issues to the final resolution. Please use 6000 words to create a very detailed code change review and analysis report on the issue original reported, all the steps taken to troubleshoot and remedy the issues, including the intermediate issues in a logical order, giving details on the root causes with explanations. Create the document as a markdown document `code_review_and_analysis_report_on_problem_resolution.md`. This document should also be of help for other projects to avoid similar pitfalls. Need to list all the files actually modified and include the "diff" output and the explanations. Thank you!
