## **1. Introduction: What is The Scent?**

**The Scent** is a free and open-source e-commerce platform, engineered from the ground up to provide the digital foundation for modern luxury and wellness brands. It aims to deliver the polish, performance, and immersive experience of top-tier online retailers in an accessible, maintainable, and highly extensible package.

This project is built with an obsessive focus on quality, both in the user experience and in the engineering. It serves not only as a functional, feature-complete store but also as a reference implementation for professional-grade web application architecture. It features a high-performance frontend built with Next.js and React, a type-safe, modular backend powered by tRPC, and a robust data layer using Prisma and PostgreSQL.

The platform's design philosophy is centered on creating a "digital sanctuary"â€”an online space where customers don't just purchase products but embark on a sensory journey that begins the moment they arrive. This is achieved through a clean, high-contrast UI, fluid animations, and a focus on intuitive, non-disruptive user flows.

## **3. Architectural Deep Dive**

The Scent is built on robust architectural principles designed for performance, maintainability, and scalability.

### **3.1 The Layered Architecture**

Our architecture strictly separates concerns into logical layers. This design ensures the application is easy to reason about, test, and extend.

1.  **Presentation Layer (`app/`, `components/`):** Built with Next.js and React, this layer is responsible for what the user sees. Server Components handle data fetching and initial render, while Client Components provide interactivity. It contains no business logic.

2.  **Application Layer (`server/`, `lib/`):** The API and business logic hub. **tRPC routers** define our API endpoints, orchestrate workflows, and enforce business rules. Service modules in `lib/` handle integrations with third-party services like Stripe and Sanity.

3.  **Data Access Layer (`prisma/`):** Implements the data repository pattern using **Prisma Client**. It provides a clean, type-safe API for all database operations, abstracting away the raw SQL.

4.  **Persistence Layer (`prisma/schema.prisma`):** Defines the database schema using the Prisma schema language, which maps directly to the PostgreSQL tables. This is the single source of truth for our data structure.

### **32. Checkout Flow Diagram**

The flow for creating a secure payment session and persisting an order is a critical, multi-step process. This diagram illustrates the robust interaction between the client, our server, Stripe, and our database.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client (React)
    participant Server (tRPC)
    participant Stripe API
    participant DB (PostgreSQL)

    User->>+Client: Fills out checkout form and clicks "Pay Now"
    Client->>+Server: Calls `createPaymentIntent` tRPC mutation (with cart details)
    Server->>+Stripe API: Creates Payment Intent with amount and metadata
    Stripe API-->>-Server: Returns `clientSecret`
    Server-->>-Client: Returns `clientSecret`
    Client->>+Stripe API: Calls `stripe.confirmPayment(clientSecret, elements)`
    Stripe API-->>-User: Processes payment (e.g., shows 3D Secure modal)
    
    alt Payment Successful
        Stripe API->>+Client: Redirects user to `/order-confirmation` page
        Client->>Client: Clears local cart state (Zustand)
        Client-->>-User: Shows "Thank You" message
        Stripe API->>+Server: Sends `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook
        Server->>Server: Verifies webhook signature
        Server->>+DB: Creates Order and OrderItem records
        DB-->>-Server: Confirms write
        Server-->>-Stripe API: Returns 200 OK
    else Payment Failed
        Stripe API-->>-Client: Shows error message in payment form
        Client-->>-User: Displays error and allows retry
    end
```
