A line starting with `//` in a JavaScript, TypeScript, or TSX file is a single‑line comment. This means that everything following the `//` on that line is ignored by the compiler or interpreter. In your example:

```tsx
// components/common/Button.tsx
```

this comment is typically used as a header or annotation to indicate the file path or purpose. It doesn't affect the code's behavior—it’s solely for developers' reference.

Comments serve several purposes:

1. **Documentation:** They help explain the purpose, behavior, or any nuances of the code.  
2. **Organization:** A header comment can quickly tell a developer which file they're looking at, especially when viewing concatenated or bundled output.  
3. **Debugging/Development Notes:** Developers can temporarily comment out code for debugging or leave notes about improvements without impacting the actual execution.

Remember that comments come in different forms. Besides single‑line comments (`//`), multi‑line comments can be written as:

```js
/* 
   This is a multi-line comment.
   It spans several lines.
*/
```

Whichever form you use, comments are an essential part of writing clear, maintainable code.

Yes – the `//` single‑line comment syntax works the same in `.js`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` files. They all use ECMAScript syntax, so anything after `//` on a line is ignored by the compiler or interpreter regardless of the file extension.

Here's a breakdown of the file types:

- **`.js` (JavaScript):**  
  This is a plain JavaScript file. It contains standard JavaScript code and runs directly in browsers or Node.js. It doesn’t include type annotations or additional syntax beyond what’s defined in ECMAScript.

- **`.ts` (TypeScript):**  
  TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static type-checking and other language features. Files ending in `.ts` contain TypeScript code without any JSX. They must be transpiled (e.g., via the TypeScript compiler) to JavaScript before they run.

- **`.tsx` (TypeScript with JSX):**  
  This extension is used when writing React components in TypeScript that include JSX syntax. JSX lets you mix HTML‑like markup with JavaScript/TypeScript logic. Because of this, you use the `.tsx` extension instead of `.ts` when your file contains JSX elements.

It’s common in Next.js projects—and many modern React codebases—to see a mix of these file types. You might have plain JavaScript for scripts or legacy code, TypeScript files for modules that need type-checking, and TSX files for React components where JSX is used.
